## C++ Server and Client

Both client and server applications in C++ have been implemented for the Records API.  See <<https://github.nrel.gov/d-star/cpp-records>> for details.  There are GUI and command-line applications for serving comma-separated-value files and a GUI application for browsing Records API data sources.
